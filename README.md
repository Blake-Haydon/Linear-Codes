# Linear Codes

This repository contains a collection of notebooks that explore the theory of linear codes. The notebooks are written in Python and are a work in progress. They are intended to be a reference as I learn more coding theory.

## **Notebooks**

- [Single Parity Bit](./parity.ipynb): A parity bit is a single bit that is added to a string of bits to ensure that the total number of 1-bits in the string is even or odd. Parity bits are used as the simplest form of error detection code.
